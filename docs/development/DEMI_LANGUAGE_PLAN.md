# Demi Language Development Priority Plan

## 🎯 Next Phase: Demi Language Frontend

Now that DemiEngine backend is solid (188/188 tests, 134 registers, 63 implemented opcodes with 88 planned), it's time to build the revolutionary Demi language on top of it.

## 📋 Immediate Development Priorities

### Phase 1: Basic Demi Language (4-6 weeks)
**Goal**: Get simple Demi programs running on DemiEngine

#### Week 1-2: Core Language Design
- [ ] Define basic Demi syntax (variables, functions, control flow)
- [ ] Create Demi lexer (tokenize .dem files)
- [ ] Design AST structure for Demi programs
- [ ] Basic error handling and reporting

#### Week 3-4: Demi → D-ISA Compiler
- [ ] AST → D-ISA assembly translation
- [ ] Symbol table management (variables, functions)
- [ ] Type checking and semantic analysis
- [ ] Integration with existing DemiEngine assembler

#### Week 5-6: Development Tools
- [ ] `demi -I program.dem` interpretation mode
- [ ] Basic error messages and debugging output
- [ ] Simple example programs and test suite

### Phase 2: Configuration System (3-4 weeks)
**Goal**: Implement Demi's revolutionary customization features

#### Week 7-8: demi.toml Configuration
- [ ] TOML parser for project configuration
- [ ] Syntax profile system (C-like, Python-like, etc.)
- [ ] Language feature toggles
- [ ] Custom keyword/operator definitions

#### Week 9-10: Dynamic Language Adaptation
- [ ] Runtime syntax switching based on config
- [ ] Project-specific dialect support
- [ ] Custom standard library loading
- [ ] Configuration validation tools

### Phase 3: Advanced Development Experience (2-3 weeks)
**Goal**: Professional development workflow

#### Week 11-12: REPL and Tooling
- [ ] Interactive REPL environment
- [ ] Live code reload/hot-swapping
- [ ] Enhanced error messages with suggestions
- [ ] `demi --help`, `--init-config`, etc.

#### Week 13: Integration and Polish
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite for Demi language
- [ ] Example projects showcasing customization
- [ ] Documentation and tutorials

## 🚀 After Demi Language is Complete

### Phase 4: Return to Native Codegen (8-10 weeks)
- Now you'll have real Demi programs to compile natively!
- Can test performance improvements with actual use cases
- Configuration system can inform optimization strategies

## 📁 Suggested Directory Structure

```
src/
├── assembler/           # D-ISA assembly (existing)
├── codegen/            # Native compilation (foundation laid, resume later)
├── demi/               # NEW: Demi language frontend
│   ├── lexer.hpp/cpp
│   ├── parser.hpp/cpp
│   ├── ast.hpp
│   ├── compiler.hpp/cpp
│   ├── config.hpp/cpp
│   └── repl.hpp/cpp
├── vhardware/          # DemiEngine VM (existing)
└── debug/              # Development tools (existing)
```

## 🎯 First Steps

1. **Create** `src/demi/` directory structure
2. **Design** basic Demi syntax (what should "Hello World" look like?)
3. **Implement** Demi lexer for tokenizing .dem files
4. **Test** with simple programs on DemiEngine VM

## 💡 Key Design Questions to Answer

1. **Default Syntax**: What should Demi look like out-of-the-box?
2. **Configuration Scope**: How granular should customization be?
3. **Compatibility**: How to maintain compatibility across syntax profiles?
4. **Performance**: How much overhead is acceptable for customization?

The native codegen foundation is excellent work - we'll return to it once Demi language can generate interesting programs to compile!
