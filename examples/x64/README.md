# x64 64-bit Examples

This directory contains assembly examples targeting **x64 64-bit architecture**.

## Register Usage

x64 64-bit uses the following general-purpose registers:
- **RAX** - Accumulator register (64-bit)
- **RBX** - Base register (64-bit)
- **RCX** - Counter register (64-bit)
- **RDX** - Data register (64-bit)
- **RSI** - Source index (64-bit)
- **RDI** - Destination index (64-bit)
- **RSP** - Stack pointer (64-bit)
- **RBP** - Base pointer (64-bit)
- **R8-R15** - Additional general-purpose registers (64-bit, x64 only)

## Running Examples

```bash
# Assemble only
./bin/demi-engine-debug -A examples/x64/basic/simple_addition.asm

# Assemble and run
./bin/demi-engine-debug examples/x64/basic/simple_addition.asm

# With hexdump
./bin/demi-engine-debug --hexdump -A examples/x64/basic/simple_addition.asm
```

## DASM Coding Standards

All examples follow DASM coding standards:
- Entry point labeled as `_start`
- Uppercase instructions (LOAD_IMM, MOV, ADD, etc.)
- Clear comments explaining each section
- Proper use of `.org` directives for memory layout
- Consistent indentation (4 spaces)

## Key Differences from x86

- Registers are 64-bit (R prefix) instead of 32-bit (E prefix)
- Larger address space (16 exabytes theoretical)
- Stack alignment is 8 bytes instead of 4 bytes
- Access to R8-R15 additional registers
- Can handle larger integers natively (e.g., factorial of 20!)

## Notes

All examples in this directory use 64-bit register conventions and demonstrate the advantages of x64 architecture for larger computations and memory addressing.
